# OpenStreetMap - ArcGIS

### Introduction

Provides a means to style OpenStreetMap data imported into ArcGIS using the [OpenStreetMap Editor for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/openstreetmap).

The styles are based on the humanitarian theme from http://openstreetmap.org/. The original style information is from [HDM-CartoCSS](https://github.com/hotosm/HDM-CartoCSS) and is based on [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto).

### Description

The style file contains symbols for 4 distinct scale levels. Each level groups 1 or more of the zoom levels from OpenStreetMap. The following images are examples of how the layers look.
